title: Engineers are not made out of college!

Hi,<br />
I will start off by introducing myself.<br />
I have been a no one for a long part of my life. <br />
<br />
And here’s why:<br />

### College Life
I went to a prestigious engineering college of my country and the only thing it taught me was that engineering sucks and the only way to get out of this mess is to get a management degree.<br />
It taught me how to pass a given examination by mugging up the answers of a few selected questions.<br />
It taught me how to get fake internship certificates.<br />
It taught me how to hate your own engineering branch.<br />
It taught me to study programming in order to get a good placement as my own branch offered a very mediocre package.<br />
And as a result I did start hating engineering and wasted some more part of my life by giving MBA exams multiple times.<br />
**NOTE**: Now when I say my college it collectively includes the faculty, my peers and my own decision making power during my college time.

### After College
Now that I have a work experience of over 3 years in various sectors, I am realising the true potential of us engineers.<br />
And I am getting inspired by so many things! <br />
My college failed to showcase these things to me.<br />
I get inspired by the magical user interfaces of some websites which make me drool.<br />
I get inspired by the image processing algorithms and optics used in my DSLR camera.<br />
I get inspired seeing how sometimes by changing a line of the code I am able to save a few precious milliseconds.<br />
I get inspired when I hear of some novel idea like that of a refrigerator which is able to process how many apples you have in it and autonomously able to order some online.<br />
I get inspired by the **Internet of Things**.<br />
**Artificial Intelligence**.<br />
**Big Data**.<br />
**Human Computer Interactions**.<br />
And the list goes on and on….<br />
I have lost all faith in my country’s education system, but nonetheless I accept this fact and move on.<br />
I have now made it a habit of regularly taking online courses and learn something new every single day. <br />
There is a deluge of information out there on the internet. <br />
I plan to keep learning new technologies I will be interested in (currently am a UX engineer). <br />
Probably next I will learn Embedded. <br />
Next I will learn handling Big Data. <br />
Yeah, that’s the way I want to live my life like.<br /><br />
But I will not stop now.<br />
And I don’t need a silly college to get me going.<br />
No I am not a no one.<br />
<br />
## I am a f****** ENGINEER !!<br />
