After writing some random posts on quora and getting a maximum of 30 upvotes, one of my post suddenly shot up and in no time I saw people from all over the world upvoting, commenting and sharing my post. I even started getting facebook friend requests by random people. Surprisingly, I got 25k upvotes within a week! So here's what the post was about.

### What is the first thing you did with your salary?

I was placed in Qualcomm. The package was good, but the joining bonus was simply phenomenal.

First salary, 2lac in the account, no girlfriend or wife. So what do you do?

I booked a trip to Europe for my parents.

And there you go, Mom and dad had a trip they recall as the best time of their life.

PS: Dad is too happy when he comes back and buys me an R15 bike. All square ;)
