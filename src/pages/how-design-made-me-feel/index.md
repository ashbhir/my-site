A lot of people struggle switching their job profile and have doubts like 'Should I be switching my career path after 2 years of work experience'. Well, I did exactly this and here I write down what triggered me do it.

### How it all began

It was sometime in August, 2014. It had been a year for me working at Qualcomm as a software engineer. Pay package was one of the best in the country. But to be honest, I was not at all satisfied with my work that mostly involved catching bugs in the driver code. Moreover, the work had become quite monotonous too.

And then, one day, when I was just browsing through the internet I came across this website [antonandirene.com](http://antonandirene.com/) rated somewhere as the best designed website. I opened it up. **And as I opened up the website, I felt as if my fingers had transformed into some form of keys that were unlocking new worlds I scrolled down the page.** All the designs and aesthetics used in the website were moving me beyond my imagination. You can see it to yourself how the tiny design patterns have been clubbed together in harmony that look so natural and appealing.

Now this is where I got introduced to my role models: Anton and Irene, two ex-directors of a big firm who had quit their job to become designers. And that was the day when I decided I want to be like them and create something as spectacular as they did.

I kept browsing and kept getting influenced by some more beautiful websites. [Mintdesign's](http://mintdesigncompany.com/) portfolio web page is another such aesthetically beautiful work. They have literally brought design to life via their art.

### So what next?

For the first time my goal in life was clear. I did quit my job, sat at home for 6 months and continued with my browsing and learning.

### Me at present

I am a Senior UI Developer at a start-up now and I am loving what I am doing. I may not have yet created a product like Anton and Irene's yet but hang on, I am not done yet! So just keep a watch on this post for an updateÂ :)
